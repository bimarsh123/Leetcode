first we need to reverse the matrix
Input          reversed
                
1 2 3           7 8 9
4 5 6   ------  4 5 6
7 8 9           1 2 3
         ||
         ||

After the matrix has been reversed successfully. We transpose the matrix
7 8 9          7 4 1
4 5 6   ------ 8 5 2
1 2 3          9 6 2
   Inorder to transpose the matrix we need to swap the row into column and column into rows
