In this problem, we can use two pointer we have to check following conditon if 
lets assume i is first pointer at the start of string and j is pointer pointing last character of a string
we have to check if i and j charcter is alpha numeric or not if not we increase i and j both fpr different conditio 
we should also check if lower i character and lower j character are not equal each other, If not equal we return False or lese we continue the two pointer by increamenting i and decreamenting j
